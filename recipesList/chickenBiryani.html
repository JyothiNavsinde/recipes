    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken pieces (bone-in or boneless)</li>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Cooking oil or ghee</li>
        <li>Onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Ginger, grated or minced</li>
        <li>Tomatoes, diced or tomato puree
           </li>
        <li> Yogurt</li>
        <li>Spices: such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garam masala, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro and mint leaves</li>
        <li>Saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>Warm milk (for soaking saffron, if using)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Water or chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken: Mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, minced garlic, grated ginger, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to infuse flavors.</li>
        <li>Prepare the rice: Rinse and soak basmati rice for about 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add salt, and cook the rice until it's parboiled (partially cooked). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions: In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Fry thinly sliced onions until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Layer the biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot or pan, spread a layer of cooked rice evenly. Top with a layer of marinated chicken, fried onions, and chopped cilantro and mint leaves. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of rice on top.</li>
        <li>Infuse saffron (optional): If using saffron, soak saffron strands in warm milk for a few minutes, then drizzle it over the top layer of rice.</li>
        <li>Seal and cook: Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to trap steam. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the chicken to cook through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve hot, garnished with additional fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves</li>
    </ol>
